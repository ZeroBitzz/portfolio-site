# My Personal Website

## Description
I wanted my personal website to look maximum epic, so I took inspiration from really old terminal ui throughout the whole site, cuz classic is cool.

## Features
I added an arbitrary loading screen for uber immersion. I also slapped in the time, in real time, with my own time, in the bottom right corner. Then I 
threw in a crt overlay on the whole thing. Why? Because it's radical.

## Credits
Used this repo as a base for my crt overlay. [CRT scanlines code](https://gist.github.com/lmas/6a1bd445bc7a7145245085f4a740d3f5)
